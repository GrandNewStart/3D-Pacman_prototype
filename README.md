# 3D-Pacman_prototype

This is my first original game done by Unity. It is a Pacman game but in 3D spaces. You are placed in a maze full of balls that you have to collect while dodging from the enemies who will constantly chase you. Collect all the balls without getting caught. It may sound simple but trust me, Dark Souls has been more forgiving than this.

This is only a prototype. I'm not sure if I will go on to finish this game and make it market-ready. We'll see about that later.
